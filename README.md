#Acumatica ERP ReST API Demonstration Application

Acu_ERP is an application to be used to show how the Rest API Client can be 
utiltized in short order using the EntityFramework, VS Scaffolding and the Identity Scaffolding availble from VS.

The application only uses the ReST API facilities. The key value from the work in this Github project is the class Models of 
each default_20.200.001 endpoint and the fact that this can be updated from release to release to new class models that can 
be incorporated if needed into this application.

For purposes of generitication, the ReST Client overloaded standard types of C# with types that are generic for Acumatica using the Entity base classes.
If using the Models generated by this is desired, unless you make provisions to inherit the same base classes you'll simply need to "translate" 
these super casts to regular C# casts.

You can find the complete ReST Client Porject here:

The solution allows to easily start developing REST API based integration with Acumatica ERP. 

The repository contains the following solutions:
1. Acumatica REST API Client - the solution contains Acumatica REST API client based on RESTSharp. The solution also contains base classes required for endpoint definitions and the endpoint definitions.
2. Example Console Application - the solution contains examples of API calls to Acumatica ERP.
3. SOAPLikeWrapperForREST - the project contains a wrapper that can be used to migrate a code that has originally been written for SOAP API to REST API.
4. EndpointModelGenerator - the solution allows to generate C# projects and classes for the REST API client based on OpenAPI 2.0 endpoint schemas.  

The Acumatica REST Client and some endpoints are also available as Nuget packages:
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/Acumatica.RESTClient/
